mv ProjectReport1_Memo.pdf "../01_Final_Documents/"
mv *.aux *.bbl *.blg *.fdb_latexmk *.fls *.log *.out "../04_Compilation_Files/"
```

To compile the updated report:
```bash
cd "02_LaTeX_Source"
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error "ProjectReport1_Updated.tex"
mv ProjectReport1_Updated.pdf "../01_Final_Documents/"
