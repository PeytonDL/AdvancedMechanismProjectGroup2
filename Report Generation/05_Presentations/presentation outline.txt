## Slide 3: Introduction to Greenhouses
### Core Greenhouse Principles
- **Function**: Creates controlled microclimate for plant growth
- **Key Requirements**:
  - High light transmission for photosynthesis
  - Thermal retention to maintain temperature
  - Moisture control for humidity management
  - Balanced ventilation to prevent overheating
- **Scaling Challenge**: Same principles, compressed space, new constraints

---

## Slide 4: Limitations of Small-Scale Greenhouses
### Scaling Effects and Challenges
- **Thermal Issues**:
  - Low thermal mass → rapid temperature swings
  - Condensation accumulation → plant damage risk
- **Access Problems**:
  - Airflow pathways easily blocked by foliage
  - Limited space for maintenance operations
  - Fragile glass panels (1/8" thick) require careful handling
- **Mechanism Constraints**:
  - Existing full-scale solutions don't scale down effectively
  - Tiny components become tedious to operate
  - Force scaling issues with cable systems and tension mechanisms

### Current Small-Scale Solutions
- **Low-tech options**: Cloches, hinged lids, sliding panels
- **Limitations**: Manual operation, no hold-open features, limited access
- **Need**: Automated, stable, one-hand operation with adjustable positioning

---

## Slide 5: Proposed Solution Overview

- **Key Features**:
  - Simultaneous top and front panel opening
  - Full, unobstructed plant access
  - Stable, adjustable hold-positions for ventilation
  - One-hand operation with spring balancing
- **Constraints**: No linkages outside footprint, wall-compatible placement

### Technical Requirements
- **Spatial**: 18" × 18" × 24" envelope, 8 cm max ground pivot height
- **Performance**: 0° to 45° rotation with translation, >90% opening area
- **Load**: Support ~5 lb each for front and top panels
- **Operation**: Single degree of freedom, single input, smooth motion

---

## Slide 6: Patent Analysis and Existing Solutions
### Full-Scale Greenhouse Patents
**Patent 1 - Portable Greenhouse (Koziol, 1974)**:
- Multiple covered sides become complex at small scale
- Mechanism components too small for reliable operation

**Patent 2 - Cable System (Jaderloon, 1999)**:
- Cable tension doesn't scale proportionally
- Precise alignment requirements become impractical
- Parts become fragile and expensive

**Patent 3 - Window Mechanism (Bom, 1978)**:
- Rigid bars and rotational joints show promise
- Triangular guide-bar linkage offers scalability
- Most suitable for adaptation to small-scale applications

### Key Insight
- **Full-scale mechanisms fail to scale down effectively**
- **New design approach required for desktop applications**

## Slide 7: Methodology - Type Synthesis Process
### Systematic Approach
- **Method**: Erdman & Sandor (1990) systematic methodology
- **Goal**: Identify optimal mechanism topology before dimensional synthesis
- **Process**: Mathematical analysis → topology evaluation → selection

### Four-Bar Analysis
- **Gruebler's Equation**: F = 3(n-1) - 2f₁ - f₂
- **Requirements**: Single DOF (F=1), revolute joints only (f₂=0)
- **Result**: Four-bar mechanisms (n=4, f₁=4) insufficient for constraints
- **Problem**: Cannot satisfy spatial constraints AND required motion

### Six-Bar Development
- **Advantage**: Two independent kinematic loops, greater design flexibility
- **Link Types**: 2 ternary links + 4 binary links (standard KLSS)
- **Topology**: Watt chain vs. Stephenson chain configurations

---

## Slide 8: Mechanism Topology Selection
### Basic Kinematic Chains (BKCs)
**Watt Chain**: Two ternary links sharing common connection
**Stephenson Chain**: Ternary links separated by binary links

### Kinematic Inversions
- **Watt I, Watt II**: Different grounding configurations
- **Stephenson I, II, III**: Various ternary link arrangements

### Selection Criteria
- **Ground Pivot Accessibility**: Critical differentiator
- **Spatial Compatibility**: Must fit within greenhouse envelope
- **Transmission Angles**: Favorable characteristics throughout motion
- **Manufacturing**: Simplicity and cost-effectiveness

---

## Slide 9: Optimal Solution - Watt I Mechanism
### Why Watt I?
- **Ground Pivots**: Two accessible pivots at front base edge (15-20 cm separation)
- **Structure**: Compact dual-loop with 8-20 cm link lengths
- **Performance**: Favorable transmission angles throughout range
- **Joints**: All seven joints as revolute (pin) joints for simplicity

### Configuration Details
- **Input**: Binary link connected to ground pivot G_A
- **Motion**: Guides door through three precision positions:
  - Closed (0°)
  - Ventilation (~30°)
  - Fully open (~45°)
- **Operation**: Single user input, unified mechanism motion

## Slide 10: Design Process Evolution
### Initial Approach
