**Date**: [Current Date]
**Course**: Advanced Mechanism Design

### Speaker Notes:
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today I'm excited to present our work on designing a mechanism for miniature tabletop greenhouses. This project addresses a real engineering challenge: how do we scale greenhouse automation from full-size applications down to desktop scale? Our solution uses a six-bar linkage mechanism to provide controlled access to plants while maintaining the functionality of larger greenhouse systems."

## SLIDE 2: Presentation Overview

### Visual Elements:
- **Layout**: Four main points with icons
- **Icons**: Problem (scaling), Solution (mechanism), Method (analysis), Results (topology)
- **Flow**: Left to right progression showing the problem-solving process

### Content:
**Title**: Presentation Overview

**Four Key Points:**

1. **Problem**: Scaling greenhouse mechanisms from full-size to desktop applications
   - Full-scale mechanisms don't work at small scale
   - New design challenges emerge

2. **Solution**: Six-bar linkage mechanism for controlled panel access
   - Provides smooth, controlled motion
   - Enables full plant access and ventilation

3. **Method**: Systematic type synthesis and patent analysis
   - Mathematical analysis of mechanism topologies
   - Evaluation of existing solutions

4. **Results**: Watt I mechanism identified as optimal topology
   - Meets all design requirements
   - Clear path forward for implementation

**Impact**: Enables practical desktop greenhouse automation

### Speaker Notes:
"Let me give you a quick overview of what we'll cover today. We started with a fundamental problem: existing greenhouse mechanisms work great at full scale, but when you try to scale them down to desktop size, they break down. Our solution is a six-bar linkage mechanism that provides controlled access to plants. We used systematic type synthesis and patent analysis to find the best approach, and we identified the Watt I mechanism as the optimal topology. The end result is a practical solution for desktop greenhouse automation."

## SLIDE 3: Introduction to Greenhouses

### Visual Elements:

- **Right Side**: Desktop greenhouse examples
- **Center**: Arrow showing scaling challenge

### Content:
**Title**: Introduction to Greenhouses

**Core Greenhouse Principles:**
- **Function**: Creates controlled microclimate for plant growth
- **Key Requirements**:
  - High light transmission for photosynthesis
  - Thermal retention to maintain temperature
  - Moisture control for humidity management
  - Balanced ventilation to prevent overheating

**Scaling Challenge**: Same principles, compressed space, new constraints

**Desktop Greenhouse Applications:**
- **Benefits**: Year-round growing, space efficiency, educational value
- **Market**: Home gardeners, educational institutions, research facilities
- **Growing Trend**: Urban agriculture, sustainable living, STEM education

### Speaker Notes:
"Let's start with the basics. A greenhouse works by creating a controlled microclimate - it lets in sunlight for photosynthesis while trapping heat and moisture to create an ideal growing environment. The key requirements are high light transmission, thermal retention, moisture control, and balanced ventilation.

Now, when we scale this down to desktop size, we face a fundamental challenge: the same principles apply, but we're working in a much more compressed space with new constraints. Desktop greenhouses offer significant benefits - year-round growing, space efficiency, and educational value. They're becoming increasingly popular for urban agriculture, sustainable living, and STEM education.

But here's the problem: the mechanisms that work great at full scale don't work when you try to scale them down. This is where our project comes in - we need to design new mechanisms specifically for small-scale applications."

## Additional Speaker Notes for Transitions:

### Transition from Slide 1 to Slide 2:
"Before we dive into the technical details, let me give you an overview of our approach and what we discovered."

### Transition from Slide 2 to Slide 3:
"To understand why this is such an interesting problem, we need to look at how greenhouses work and what happens when we try to scale them down."

### Transition from Slide 3 to Slide 4:
"Now that we understand the basic principles, let's look at the specific challenges that emerge when we try to scale greenhouse mechanisms to desktop size."
